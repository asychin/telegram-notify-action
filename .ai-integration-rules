## 🧠 Intelligence Rules

### 1. Smart Configuration Detection
```yaml
smart_detection:
  secrets_analysis:
    existing_telegram:
      - scan: repository secrets for TELEGRAM_*
      - detect: organization-level telegram configs
      - identify: multi-environment setups
    
    missing_secrets:
      - generate: setup instructions
      - suggest: naming conventions (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_{ENV})
      - create: environment-specific variables
  
  workflow_optimization:
    job_placement:
      - start_notifications: first job with needs: []
      - progress_notifications: after critical jobs
      - final_notifications: always() condition jobs
    
    conditional_logic:
      - success_path: when all jobs succeed  
      - failure_path: when any job fails
      - partial_success: when some matrix jobs fail
```

### 2. Template Selection Algorithm
```yaml
template_selection:
  basic_project:
    triggers: [simple workflow, < 3 jobs]
    template: success/error with basic info
    variables: [repository, branch, commit, actor]
  
  standard_project:  
    triggers: [build + deploy jobs, testing]
    template: deploy template with statistics
    variables: [all basic + duration, test results]
  
  enterprise_project:
    triggers: [complex matrix, multi-env, > 5 jobs]
    template: comprehensive with dynamic updates
    variables: [all + progress tracking, stage timings]
  
  microservices_project:
    triggers: [multiple services, docker matrix]
    template: service-specific notifications
    variables: [service names, deployment matrix]
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategies

### 1. Non-Disruptive Integration
```yaml
integration_approach:
  minimal_changes:
    - add notification steps without modifying existing logic
    - use conditional notifications (success/failure only)
    - preserve existing workflow structure
  
  enhanced_integration:
    - add progress tracking between existing jobs
    - implement dynamic message updates
    - include deployment statistics and timing
  
  comprehensive_overhaul:
    - restructure workflows for optimal notification flow
    - implement advanced features (file uploads, keyboards)
    - add monitoring and alerting capabilities
```

### 2. Configuration Templates

#### A. Simple Integration (Basic Projects)
```yaml
simple_integration:
  add_to_existing_job:
    - name: 📢 Notify Deployment Status
      if: always()
      uses: asychin/telegram-notify-action@v3
      with:
        telegram_token: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN }}
        chat_id: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID }}
        template: ${{ job.status == 'success' && 'success' || 'error' }}
        message: ${{ job.status == 'success' && 'Deployment completed!' || 'Deployment failed!' }}
```

#### B. Dynamic Integration (Advanced Projects)  
```yaml
dynamic_integration:
  start_notification:
    job: notify-start
    capture: message_id, start_time
    template: deployment start with progress bar
  
  progress_updates:
    jobs: [build, test, deploy]  
    action: update existing message
    template: progress with stage completion
  
  final_notification:
    job: notify-complete
    condition: always()
    template: comprehensive summary with timings
```

#### C. Enterprise Integration (Complex Projects)
```yaml
enterprise_integration:
  features:
    - multi-environment notifications
    - service-specific progress tracking  
    - failure analysis and debugging info
    - rollback notifications
    - health check integration
    - custom keyboards for manual actions
```

    - check: action.yml for current version (v3)
    - validate: deprecated features in user's existing setup
    - suggest: migration paths for older versions
    - warn: about breaking changes
```

### 2. Context-Aware Examples
```yaml
example_generation:
  based_on_project_type:
    node_js:
      - npm install/build examples
      - package.json version in notifications
      - test coverage integration
    
    docker:
      - container build notifications
      - image size and layer information
      - registry push confirmations
    
    kubernetes:
      - deployment status tracking
      - pod health notifications  
      - rollout progress updates
```

## 🔒 Security and Best Practices

### 1. Secrets Management Rules
```yaml
security_rules:
  token_setup:
    - never: expose tokens in code or logs
    - always: use repository/organization secrets
    - suggest: environment-specific token naming
    - validate: token permissions and chat access
  
  data_privacy:
    - avoid: sensitive data in notifications (passwords, keys)
    - sanitize: error messages and logs
    - limit: information exposure in public repositories
```

### 2. Workflow Security
```yaml
workflow_security:
  permissions:
    - minimal: only required permissions for each job
    - secure: use specific action versions (@v3, not @main)
    - validate: third-party action usage
  
  error_handling:
    - graceful: failure handling without breaking pipelines
    - informative: error messages without sensitive data
    - recoverable: continue-on-error for non-critical notifications
```

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

### 1. Integration Testing Strategy
```yaml
testing_approach:
  dry_run:
    - simulate: notification sending without actual Telegram calls
    - validate: message formatting and variable substitution
    - check: conditional logic and job dependencies
  
  staging_test:
    - test: with actual Telegram bot in test environment
    - verify: message delivery and formatting
    - validate: file attachments and special features
  
  production_validation:
    - gradual: rollout with limited notifications
    - monitor: delivery success and error rates
    - feedback: user experience and preferences
```

### 2. Quality Assurance Rules
```yaml
quality_rules:
  message_quality:
    - readable: clear and informative messages
    - actionable: include relevant links and context
    - timely: sent at appropriate workflow stages
  
  performance_impact:
    - minimal: workflow execution time increase
    - reliable: handle Telegram API rate limits
    - resilient: graceful degradation on service issues
```

## 🚨 **Critical Reminders**

### **Version Management**
- ⚠️ **Always** use specific version tags: `@v3.1.0` (not `@main` or `@latest`)
- 🔄 Update version references when new releases are available
- 📋 Check CHANGELOG.md for breaking changes between versions

### **Variable Usage Rules** 
- 🎯 Template variables (`{{var}}`) work ONLY in `message:`/`caption:` WITH `template:`
- ⚙️ GitHub Actions variables (`${{var}}`) work in `template_vars:`, `inline_keyboard:`, `run:` commands
- 🚫 Never mix template and GitHub Actions variable types

### **Security First**
- 🔐 Always use repository/organization secrets
- 🚫 Never expose tokens in code or logs  
- 🛡️ Use minimal required permissions
- 🔍 Sanitize sensitive data in notifications

---

**Remember: This is an intelligent integration system. Always prioritize user experience, security, and non-disruptive implementation. The goal is to enhance existing workflows, not replace them.**
